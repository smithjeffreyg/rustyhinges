Hi, I'm Jeff Smith. I have have been a lawn mower, fishing and commercial deckhand, delivery truck driver, pastor, musician, professor, psychometrist, grief counselor, and psychotherapist. I hold a Doctorate in Psychology from Northwest University.

My professional interests include posttraumatic growth, trauma, individualism, change, grief, and grit. Personal interests include reading, nutrition, music, technology, philosophy, voluntaryism, sports, business, and laughter. My aim is to think and speak the truth as clearly as I can. 

I live in Washington State with my wife and three children.
